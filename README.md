# NASS-Strawberries
#Hello, here is my Strawberries assignment. 

#The qmd that generates the report is Strawberries_EDA.qmd. 

#The submission is Strawberries_EDA.pdf

#The USDA_NASS data cleaning-oct6.qmd file is the file I downloaded from 
#Blackboard which contains Havilands cleaning, as well as my own cleaning and 
#some additional playing around with data I did. I wrote the results of Havilands
#cleaning into strwb_survey. This was then read in for the rest of the analysis.
